# Algorithm to Find the Rook by Giving a Movement in Algebraic Notation

## The current Idea is:

### What do we have ?

- The destiny
- The capture information
- Information of disambiguation

### Algorithm

- Find the rects that intersect the destiny position
- Find the rooks of this team that intersect with those rects
- Find all the legal movements involving those rooks (Collision algorithm)
- If none legal movement was found: return impossible movement
- If one was found: Do the movement
- If two or more was found: check if there is some information of disambiguation.
  - If  there is: See whether all other options was eliminated and only one left
    - If yes: Do the movement
    - If no: Then return that the movement was not disambiguated
